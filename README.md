# RSS Feed for the SPA Framework

This is a pretty simple plugin, it adds an RSS feed to a site running off the SPA framework.

It adds one option that can be set, what post types to include in the RSS feed. This can be set in the 'theme options' page (if you're using an un-edited admin page).

The endpoint for the RSS feed is `www.mysite.com/api/get/rssFeed`
